* Let files load in other files; so a generator could pull from an external .csv file for its items. This would make merging generators between mods **MUCH** easier

* Make other types available for evars (currently only ints work; strings and arrays would be ideal)

* Make "on any equipment use" trigger for Jester's Snap/Discard

* Anything which references `e` doesn't work for reuseable items - `e.dicehistory`, `e.getvar` etc

* Reuseable items' slots revert back to normal if changed with `eq.changeslots()`. This causes a few issues:
	* If you have a reuseable item, changing the slots to ones which accept different dice can cause the dice to be spat out. For example, calling `eq.changeslots([~MAX4~]);` on Dagger will spit a 4 out after you put it in, letting you deal unlimited damage.
	* Similarly, on fury, reuseable items with changed slots don't respect that. If you change Dagger's slots to [~MAX3~|~FREE1~], and use Fury on it, only the first attack takes the FREE1 into consideration. The first attack will deal []+1 damage, the second one will deal [] damage (though visually, neither of them animate with the FREE1)
	
* A "on re-equip" script hook

* Maybe an "on update" script hook? Something that constantly updates each frame - this would let you do things like track the player's health better

* Some way to expose the "overkill damage" done by an item - currently the Cactus remix is hardcoded

* Get a reference to the equipment used in the "On any equipment use" and "On any countdown reduce" script fields

* Let `eq.doequipmentaction()` work for Jester - currently you have to set `equipdelay` to -0.3 in order for it to work, otherwise the activated item just snaps back into place

* A "global script" csv, which holds common hooks (start turn, end turn, on any equipment use) which load scripts to be active constantly. Would make status effects easier to code (unless there's already framework in place for custom statuses)

* Being able to merge certain cells - for example, a mod which changes everything to size 2 could merge everything using only the name and size field in equipment.csv.
