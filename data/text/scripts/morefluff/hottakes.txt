Witch isn't so bad
Warrior is deep and fun
1000 items is too many
this is a bad pun
more enemies need Silence
Loud Bird is fine
Candle is OP
Boomerang > Spiked Shield
Buster > Ultima
Jackpots need buffing
Elim Round is a mistake
Beatrice is unoriginal
old Buster was better
original Lock? was cool
I wasted a dice on this
Lockpick should be MIN2
this is Sword power creep
