hello onlookers! please ignore this :)
* Colours:
0 - gray
1 - blue (not used)
2 - red
3 - green
4 - yellow
5 - purple
6 - cyan (not used)
7 - white (intermingled with gray)
8 - brightcyan
9 - orange
10 - black (shocked!)
11 - pink
12+ - crashes, do not try

e.shockedsetting = 1 when shocked, 0 when unshocked

use [] items to activate, then deal [] damage
pogo stick? water gun? fidget spinner? yoyo? marbles? lasso? glowstick?

* JITB doesn't work (discard isn't counted as an item use)
* Balisong doesn't work (changeslots spits out the dice)
	* consider a dummy "balisong" item which is swapped out for the real item on start, which then has its slots changed from NORMAL to REQUIRE1
	* would technically work?
	* dunno how it would react to having multiple dice in it though
	* 99% sure it just... Wouldn't
* Binding Spell doesn't work (eq.getslots() doesn't work on enemy items on your turn)
	* make it "set an enemy dice to []", boring but works
	
	* renamed to Petrification Spell
	* works now!!!!
* A way to find out which item was used on "On any equipment use"
* "On any dice use" hook, which could let us make our own descriptions like Mechanical Leg
	* kind of fixed with on any countdown reduce?
* eq.getslots() should be usable on enemy items without breaking
	* (maybe fixed?)
	* fixed
* Discard/Snap should count as an equipment use for consistency (Robot's skillcard counts)
	* still fixedn't

Yoinked ideas:
* Befuddle
* Chisel
* Flail (Mace/Pavise)
* Shichishito (kinda, Lucky 7/Nunchuks)
* Magnifying Glass (kinda, inspired a new witch item)


* disable polymorph for scathach (?)
	* NAAAAAAH IT'S FUN
* thorium hammer fury
	* ughghhghghhhhhhhhghghhghgghhgghhghhghghgghhhh
	* inconsistent, so nah
* recheck animation times for burn/freeze/shock/weaken, you can set a delay

* new jester packs:
	* plug & play
	* blind
	
	
hookshotdice!?!?!?
